[//]: # (TODO: Add visuals examples)

Ulysses Unified Tokens enables users to access liquidity pools from multiple chains using a single, unified token. These tokens serve as wrappers for two or more Ulysses Liquidity Pools (ULPs) from various chains, making them available and functional in any decentralized application (dApp) on any network.

## Compatibility and Design

Ulysses Unified Tokens are compatible with any number of ERC-20 tokens and are designed primarily for use with Ulysses LPs. These tokens enable users to add or remove underlying assets at a fixed ratio, offering flexibility and control. Plus, the 1:1 ratio between the LP and underlying assets simplifies asset value tracking.

## Use Cases for Ulysses Unified Tokens

### Trading and Liquidity Provision

Ulysses Unified Tokens can be utilized for trading and providing liquidity to other pools. For instance, users can trade their Ulysses Unified Token for another asset on the Binance Smart Chain using Uniswap V3. They can also add liquidity to an Arbitrum pool from Optimism with their Ulysses Unified Token.

### Building Blocks for Other Applications

Ulysses Unified Tokens can serve as a foundation for other applications. A lending platform might use them as collateral, allowing users to borrow against their assets across multiple chains. Similarly, a stablecoin issuer could leverage Ulysses Unified Tokens to create a multichain stablecoin pegged to the value of multiple underlying assets.

## Conclusion

Ulysses Unified Tokens are an innovative token type that enables users to access liquidity pools from multiple chains through a single, unified token. They offer flexibility, control, and simplified asset value tracking for users. These tokens can be used for trading, adding liquidity, and as building blocks for other applications, such as lending and stablecoin issuance. By allowing users to manage digital assets across various chains, Ulysses Unified Tokens help reduce fragmented liquidity and increase capital efficiency.
