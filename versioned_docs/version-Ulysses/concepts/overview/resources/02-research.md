# ∆: Solving the Bridging Trilemma

Authors: Ryan Zarick, Bryan Pellegrino and Caleb Banister

> In contrast to existing cross-chain bridges which minttheir own tokens on the destination chain in response tothe user locking up assets on the source chain,∆Bridgesconduct transfers without involving any intermediate to-kens. This direct use of native assets is what enables ∆ Bridges to scale better than other cross-chain bridges,and is made possible by a pool of liquidity maintained onevery chain in the ∆ network
