Thanks to our Port architecture design, the platform's capital efficiency can be raised by deploying the Port's liquidity into Port Startegies. These contracts have the permission to manage a portion of the locked assets earning yield and apply them in low-risk strategies (i.e. Providing Eth Mainnet USDC liquidity in AAVE).
