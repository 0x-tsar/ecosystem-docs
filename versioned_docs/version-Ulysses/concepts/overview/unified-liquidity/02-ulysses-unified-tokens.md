[//]: # (TODO: Add visuals examples)

Ulysses Unified Tokens are a new type of token that allows users to access liquidity pools from multiple chains in a single, unified token. These tokens are wrappers of two or more Ulysses Liquidity Pools (ULPs) from different chains, allowing them to be used and accessible in any DAPP from any chain, such as trading and adding liquidity with Uniswap V3 on Arbitrum from Binance Smart Chain.

Ulysses Unified tokens support any number of ERC-20 tokens, and do not necessarily need to be Ulysses LPs, but are designed for them. These tokens allow for the adding and removing of underlying assets in a fixed ratio, providing flexibility and control for users. Additionally, the 1:1 ratio between the LP and underlying assets allows for easy tracking of asset values.

## Using Ulysses Unified Tokens

Ulysses Unified Tokens can be used in a variety of ways, such as trading and adding liquidity to other pools. For example, a user can trade their Ulysses Unified Token for another asset on the Binance Smart Chain using Uniswap V3. Additionally, a user can add liquidity to a liquidity pool in Arbitrum from Optimism using their Ulysses Unified Token.

Ulysses Unified Tokens can also be used as a building block for other applications. For example, a lending platform could use Ulysses Unified Tokens as collateral, allowing users to borrow against their assets across multiple chains. Similarly, a stablecoin issuer could use Ulysses Unified Tokens to create a multi-chain stablecoin, which is pegged to the value of multiple underlying assets.

## Conclusion

Ulysses Unified Tokens are a revolutionary new type of token that allows users to access liquidity pools from multiple chains in a single, unified token. These tokens provide flexibility, control and easy tracking of asset value for users. They can be used for trading and adding liquidity. They can also be used as building blocks for other applications, such as lending and stablecoin issuance. Ulysses Unified tokens are a powerful tool for managing digital assets across different chains and combat fragmented liquidity, raising capital efficiency.
