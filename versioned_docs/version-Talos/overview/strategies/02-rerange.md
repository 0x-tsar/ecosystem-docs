A key feature of TALOS is the ability to rerange positions. This refers to the process of adjusting the distribution of liquidity across a given range of assets. This can be done by either expanding or narrowing the range of assets that the liquidity is distributed across.

When expanding the range, the same amount of liquidity is spread out over a larger number of assets, which can potentially increase the liquidity of assets that were previously less liquid. This can be beneficial for market makers and traders as it can increase the trading volume and liquidity of the assets, making it easier to buy and sell them.

On the other hand, when narrowing the range, the same amount of liquidity is concentrated on a smaller number of assets. This can increase the liquidity of the assets that are included in the narrowed range, but it can also increase the volatility of the assets that are excluded from the range. This strategy can be useful for market makers and traders who are looking to focus on a specific set of assets and increase their liquidity.
