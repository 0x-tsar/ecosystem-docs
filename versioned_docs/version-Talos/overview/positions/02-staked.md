TALOS Staked Positions are a new type of LP that allows users to stake their UNI V3 NFTs in the Hermes Uniswap V3 gauge. These staked positions are built on the Arbitrum layer 2 solution, which allows for faster and cheaper transactions compared to the Ethereum mainnet.

## Benefits

- Staked Liquidity: TALOS Staked Positions allow users to stake their UNI V3 NFTs in the Hermes Uniswap V3 gauge, earning HERMES rewards instead of fees for providing liquidity to the gauge.

- Faster and Cheaper Transactions: By using the Arbitrum layer 2 solution, TALOS Staked Positions provide faster and cheaper transactions compared to the Ethereum mainnet.

- Composability: The staked position is an ERC-20 wrapper token that can be traded on the Ethereum blockchain, providing liquidity and composability to the underlying assets.

- Flexibility: TALOS Staked Positions can be used to build a wide variety of positions and strategies, giving users a high degree of flexibility in how they manage their liquidity.

## Disadvantages

- Risk: As with any liquidity provision, there is the risk of impermanent loss, leading to losses for the liquidity provider.

- Staking Requirements: Staking UNI V3 NFTs in the Hermes Uniswap V3 gauge may have a minimum range requirement for Uniswap V3 NFTs.
