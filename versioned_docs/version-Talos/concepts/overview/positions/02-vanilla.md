Transparent Automated Liquidity Omnichain Strategies (TALOS) Vanilla Positions are a type of liquidity pool that allows users to hold UNI V3 NFTs without staking them in the Hermes Uniswap V3 gauge. These Vanilla Positions are built on the Ethereum blockchain, providing liquidity and composability to the underlying assets. They can also be used to build complex positions and strategies.

## Benefits

- Non-Staked Liquidity: TALOS Vanilla Positions allow users to hold UNI V3 NFTs without staking them in the Hermes Uniswap V3 gauge. This can be beneficial for users who want to provide liquidity to the market and earn fees instead of Hermes emissions.

- Composability: Because TALOS Vanilla Positions are Uniswap V3 NFT wrappers, they are fully composable with existing applications for them. This allows users to easily create complex positions and strategies by combining their TALOS Vanilla Positions with other liquidity pools and assets.

- Liquidity: By providing liquidity to the underlying assets, TALOS Vanilla Positions can help to increase the trading volume and liquidity of the assets, making it easier to buy and sell them.

- Flexibility: TALOS Vanilla Positions can be used to build a wide variety of positions and strategies, giving users a high degree of flexibility in how they manage their liquidity.

## Disadvantages

- Risk: As with any liquidity provision, there is a risk that the value of the underlying assets may decrease, leading to losses for the liquidity provider.

- Fees: There may be fees associated with maintaining Vanilla TALOS positions.
