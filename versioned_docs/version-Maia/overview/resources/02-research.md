# Announcement Article

> Our goal is to ease inflation rewarding users by sealing their current percentage of the protocol and have strategic emissions via bonds to grow our treasury revenue sources and fund future development.
We will leverage a set of measures to enable clear revenue sources to be directed to stakers, while maintaining sustainable treasury growth.
These changes unlocks incentives that enable directing Maia DAO’s Voting Power over Hermes Protocol emissions (à la Convex) to Maia stakers. Ensuring lockers incentives are well aligned to those of the protocol so users benefit from acting in the protocols best interest.
