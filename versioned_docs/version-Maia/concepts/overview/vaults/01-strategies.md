## How do Maia Vaults increase your yields?

### Hermes Synergy

The Maia DAO holds a position in bHermes, which allows users to leverage the benefits of [boosting](../tokenomics/boost) to increase rewards earned in the Maia strategy vaults. This allows users to optimize their returns and enhance their overall yield farming strategy.

### Strategic Partnerships

MaiaDAO's vision: providing the user with the most utility with the least input materialized in meaningful partnerships with protocols that complement
our product. That way our users' DeFi experience is less fragmented and more akin to the experience in a multiservice CEX, of course without the custody counterparty risks.

Both the Hermes V2 architecture using [Uniswap V3 pools](../../../Hermes/concepts/overview/gauges/uni-v3) under the hood and Maia's strategy vaults will be a prime example of those synergies.

## Upcoming Features

### Autocompounding Mode

Maia Vaults make use of MEV and game theory to incentive participants to keep the vaults which enabled AUTOCOMPOUND MODE autocompounded in exchange for a small fee taken from rewards. This provides a decentralized and less-extractive approach to autocompounding than charging a fee up-front. 

### Leverage

mVaults can leverage their deposited principal to maximize or hedge yields while farming, enabling integrations not limited to Hermes Omnichain AMM positions.
