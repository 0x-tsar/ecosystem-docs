[//]: # (TODO: Be more specific on where the emissions go)

HERMES has an inflationary supply and its emissions are the main driver behind the utility provided by the platform. Emissions are used to pay for the yield generated by the deposited assets. Thanks to the gauge system, the Hermes Protocol directs this inflation towards the creation of revenue instead of locked value.

Emissions are determined by the Minter contract according to the burned HERMES supply ratio. Theoretically, this means that if in a given epoch every HERMES were to be burned, causing the bHERMES supply to match the former's, no emissions would be minted to distribute to Gauges and their Providers.

## Distribution

In this process, 95% of the weekly distribution is allocated depending on votes from bHERMES holders. The remaining 5% is pledged to assure stable HERMES liquidity, essential to the well-functioning of the protocol. This system ensures that the protocol remains profitable and sustainable in the long term, as well as providing an incentive for bHERMES holders to participate in the governance of the platform.

It's important to note that Emissions are decided at the end of each epoch and are linearly distributed throughout the whole epoch. This allows for a more smooth distribution of emissions and less volatility for the users and liquidity providers.
