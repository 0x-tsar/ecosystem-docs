## Delegation

bHermes Votes allows delegations to multiple delegatees up to a user's balance. This allows users to delegate their balance to multiple delegatees that they trust and support to vote on their behalf in governance proposals. bHermes Votes holders need to have delegated power to participate in governance. bHermes Votes holders that want to use their own governance power need to delegate it to themselves before a governance proposal is submitted. bHermes Votes can be delegated/undelegated at any time.
