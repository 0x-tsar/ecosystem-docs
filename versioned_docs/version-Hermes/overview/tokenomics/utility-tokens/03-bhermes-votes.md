bHermes Votes is the Hermes Protocol governance token which allows delegations to multiple delegatees up to a user's balance. This allows users to delegate their balance to multiple delegatees that they trust and support to vote on their behalf in governance proposals.

bHermes Votes holders need to have delegated power to participate in governance. bHermes Votes holders that want to use their own governance power need to delegate it to themselves before a governance proposal is submitted.

bHERMES Votes token holders can participate in various governance decisions, shaping the protocol's future, including:

- Adding or removing gauges
- Adding or removing bribes
- Adding Ulysses Ports to new chains
- Adding or removing partners from the Ecosystem Partnership Program
- Implementing or revoking Gauge Systems
- Adjusting the weight of Ulysses Pools
- Adjusting the weight of Ulysses Tokens
- Changing parameters in the Hermes Minter
- Incorporating or eliminating new Ulysses Root Routers
- Adding Destinations to Ulysses Pools
- Integrating or discontinuing Ulysses Pools from Ulysses Tokens
