[//]: # (TODO: Add pratical examples of each bullet point of the benifits to burn hermes)

bHERMES is the governance token of the Hermes Protocol, a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform that allows users to earn yield on their deposited assets. In order to unlock the voting capabilities of their HERMES, a user must first permanently lock it, or as we call it, burn it by depositing into the Burner ERC-4626 Vault Contract, which will be available within the platform's user interface (UI). In return, they will receive shares in the form of Burned Hermes (bHERMES) ERC-20 proportional to their deposit following a given conversion ratio.

This burning conversion ratio starts at a 1:1 ratio upon the launch of version 2 and grows with inflation, thus providing dilution protection to voters.

## Benefits

### Governance Participation

bHERMES holders can vote on proposals and create new ones, allowing them to have a say in the direction of the protocol.

### Propose new Gauges

bHERMES holders can propose a new Gauge to be added into the protocol, expanding the investment opportunities for the community.


### Direct HERMES Emissions to Gauges

bHERMES holders can vote on Gauges to determine their share of emissions, allowing them to influence the distribution of newly minted HERMES among the different Gauges on the platform.

### Collect Bribes

bHERMES holders can earn bribes in exchange for their voting power allocation to a given gauge, providing an additional reward for their participation in the governance of the platform.

### Earn boosted revenue on your Gauge deposits

bHERMES holders can earn a boost of up to 2.5x on their strategy yields according to their bHERMES balance. This boost is earned on top of the standard rewards earned on the platform, making it an attractive feature for users looking to maximize their returns on liquidity provided.

## Conclusion

bHERMES is the governance token of the Hermes Protocol, allowing holders to vote on proposals and create new ones, propose new gauges, direct HERMES emissions to gauges, collect bribes and earn boosted revenue on your gauge deposits. All these features make bHERMES an essential part of the Hermes Protocol, allowing the community to govern the protocol and earn more rewards.
