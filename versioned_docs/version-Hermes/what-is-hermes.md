Welcome to Hermes Protocol ðŸ‘‹

Hermes Protocol V2 is a complete revamp of V1, with the codebase having been fully re-written, packed with new and improved features, and fully audited. This major upgrade to the previous version of the protocol introduces new and improved features to enhance the user experience in the DeFi space. The protocol is decentralized and permissionless, meaning anyone can use it without the need for permission from a central authority.

At its core, Hermes Protocol V2 is an Omnichain yield and liquidity marketplace that is community-owned and future-proof. The protocol has been designed to improve upon key mechanics like ve(3,3) mechanics from V1 and to address some of the limitations of existing DeFi protocols.

### Omnichain Concentrated and Unified Liquidity

One of the key features of Hermes Protocol V2 is the ability to swap from and to any chain, using concentrated and unified liquidity. This allows users to easily move between different chains and to take advantage of the unique features and opportunities offered by each. Additionally, users can provide liquidity from and to any of the chains where Hermes is deployed, making it a truly Omnichain liquidity marketplace.

### Renting liquidity

Hermes Protocol V2 also includes a Liquidity Provision assistant, which is designed to make it easier for users to provide liquidity to the protocol and to earn rewards for doing so. The protocol also includes a bribes system, where users can rent liquidity via the already in place bribes system.

### Yield Marketplace

Finally, the last major feature of Hermes Protocol V2 is the introduction of a yield marketplace, where users can buy and sell the rights to yield. This allows users to earn returns on their assets in a more flexible and efficient way, and to take advantage of the different yield opportunities available on different chains.
